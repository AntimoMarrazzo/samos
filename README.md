# SAMOS (Suite for Analysis of Molecular Simulations)

This software, distributed openly and free of charge (see LICENCE), analyzes molecular dynamics simulations.
Currently implemented are:
    * The estimate of tracer and charge diffusion coefficients from the mean-square displacements or the integral of the velocity-autocorrelation function
    * The calculation of atomic probability densities
    * Radial distribution functions
    * Several plotting utilities

To install, clone or download this repository, move into the directory of this file, and type::
